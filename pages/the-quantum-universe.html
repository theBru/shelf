            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>The subatomic realm has a reputation for weirdness, spawning any number of profound misunderstandings, journeys into Eastern mysticism, and woolly pronouncements on the interconnectedness of all things. Cox and Forshaw’s contention? There is no need for quantum mechanics to be viewed this way. There is a lot of mileage in the weirdness of the quantum world, and it often leads to confusion and, frankly, bad science. <i>The Quantum Universe</i> cuts through the Wu Li and asks what observations of the natural world made it necessary, how it was constructed, and why we are confident that, for all its apparent strangeness, it is a good theory.</p>
            <p>The quantum mechanics of The Quantum Universe provide a concrete model of nature that is comparable in its essence to Newton’s laws of motion, Maxwell’s theory of electricity and magnetism, and Einstein’s theory of relativity.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>Quantum. The word is at once evocative, bewildering and fascinating. Depending on your point of view, it is either a testament to the profound success of science or a symbol of the limited scope of human intuition as we struggle with the inescapable strangeness of the subatomic domain. To a physicist, quantum mechanics is one of the three greal pillars supporting our understanding of the natural world, the others being Einstein's theories of Special and General Relativity. Einstein's theories deal with the nature of space and time and the force of gravity. Quantum mechanics deals with everything else, and one can argue that it doesn't matter a jot whether it is evocative, bewildering or fascinating; it's simply a theory that describes the way things behave. Measured by this pragmatic yardstick, it is quite dazzling in its precision and explanatory power. There is a test of quantum electrodynamics, the oldest and most well understood of the modern quantum theories, which involves measuring the eay an electron behaves in the vicinity of a magnet. Theoretical physicists worked hard for years using pens, paper and computers to predict what the experiments should find. Experimenters built and operated delicate experiments to tease out the finer details of Nature. Both camps independently returned precision results, comparable in their accuracy to measuring the distance between Manchester and New York to within a few centimetres. Remarkably, the number returned by the experimenters agreed exquisitely with that computed by the theorists; measurement and calculation were in perfect agreement.</p>
