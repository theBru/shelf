            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Remember when love was supposed to Trump hate? Remember when the oil companies and bankers seemed to be running scared? What the hell happened? And what can we do about it?</p>
            <p>Naomi Klein - scourge of brand bullies and corporate crooks - shows us how we got here, and how we can make things better.</p>
            <p><i>No Is Not Enough</i> reveals, among other things, that the disorientation we're feeling is deliberate. That around the world, shock political tactics are being used to generate crisis after crisis, designed to force through policies that will destroy people, the environment, the economy and our security. That extremism isn't a freak event - it's a toxic cocktail of our times.</p>
            <p>This book is a toolkit for shock resistance. From how to trash the Trump megabrand to the art of reclaiming the populist argument, Naomi Klein shows all of us how we can break the spell and win the world we need. Don't let them get away with it.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>Shock.</p>
