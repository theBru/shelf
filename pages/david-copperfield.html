            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>David Copperfield is the story of a young manâ€™s adventures on his journey from an unhappy &amp; impoverished childhood to the discovery of his vocation as a successful novelist.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have been informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o'clock at night. It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously.</p>
