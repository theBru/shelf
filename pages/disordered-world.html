            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>In this brilliantl exploration of the post-9/11 world, the internationally celebrated Lebanese novelist and intellectual
                Amin Maalouf sets out to understand the urgent challenges the world faces today. Instead of seeing the current
                disorder of the post-9/11 world as a 'clash of civilisations' Maalouf sees it as the 'exhaustion of two civilisations',
                a period in which humanity has reached its threshold of 'moral incompetence'. <i>Disordered World</i> is
                a plea by one of the major writers of our time for intelligence, tolerance and a sense of urgency on order
                that we develop a mature vision of our patrimony, our beliefs, our differences and the future of the planet
                which is our common home.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>When the Berlin Wall fell, a hopeful breeze blew across the world. The end of the stand-off between the West
                and the Soviet Union removed the threat of a nuclear cataclysm which had hung over our heads for forty years.
                We believed that democracy would now gradually spread until it encompassed the whole planet; the barriers
                between countries would fall; the movement of people, goods, images and ideas would develop unimpeded, ushering
                in an era of progress and prosperity. On each of these fronts there were some remarkable advances to begin
                with. But the further we went, the more disoriented we became.</p>
