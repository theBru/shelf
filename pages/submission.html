            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>In a near-future France, François, a middle-aged academic, is watching his life slowly dwindle to nothing. His
                sex drive is diminished, his parents are dead, and his lifelong obsession – the ideas and works of the nineteenth-century
                novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans – has led him nowhere. In a late-capitalist society where consumerism has become
                the new religion, François is spiritually barren, but seeking to fill the vacuum of his existence.</p>
            <p>And he is not alone. As the 2022 Presidential election approaches, two candidates emerge as favourites: Marine
                Le Pen of the Front National, and Muhammed Ben Abbes of the nascent Muslim Fraternity. Forming a controversial
                alliance with the mainstream parties, Ben Abbes sweeps to power, and overnight the country is transformed.
                Islamic law comes into force: women are veiled, polygamy is encouraged and, for François, life is set on
                a new course.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>Through all the years of my sad youth Huysmans remained a companion, a faithful friend; never once did I doubt
                him, never once was I tempted to drop him or take up another subject; then, one afternoon in June 2007, after
                waiting and putting it off as long as I could, even slightly longer than it was allowed, I defended ny dissertation,
                'Joris-Karl Huysmans: Out of the Tunnel', before the jury of the University of Paris IV-Sorbonne. The next
                morning (or maybe that evening, I don't remember: I spent the night of my defence alone and very drunk) I
                realised that part of my life, probably the best part, was behind me.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>A boy ran down a hill path screaming. The boy was I. He held his hands up and out in front of him as if he'd
                dipped them in paint and was coming to make a picture, to press them down to paper, but all there was on
                him was dirt. There was no blood on his palms.</p>
