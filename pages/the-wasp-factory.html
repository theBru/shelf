            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Two years after I killed Blyth I murdered my young brother Paul, for quite different reasons than I'd disposed of Blyth, and then a year after that I did for my young cousin Esmerelda more or less on a whim.</p>
            <p>That's my score to date.</p>
            <p>Three</p>
            <p>I haven't killed anybody for years, and don't intend to ever again.</p>
            <p>It was just a stage I was going through.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>I had been making the rounds of the Sacrifice Poles the day we heard my brother had escaped. I already knew something was going to happen; the Factory told me.</p>
