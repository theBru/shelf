            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Don Quixote has become so entranced by reading chivalric romances, that he determines to become a knight-errant himself. In the company of his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, his exploits blossom in all sorts of wonderful ways. While Quixote's fancy often leads him astray – he tilts at windmills, imagining them to be giants – Sancho acquires cunning and a certain sagacity. Sane madman and wise fool, they roam the world together.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>In a certain corner of la Mancha, the name of which I do not choose to remember, there lately lived one of those country gentlemen, who adorned their halls with a rusty lance and worm-eaten target, and ride forth on the skeleton of a horse, to course with a sort of a starved greyhound.</p>
