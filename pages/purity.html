            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Purity Tyler, known to all as Pip, is an outspoken, forthright young woman struggling to make a life for herself.
                She sleeps in an rickety commune in Oakland. She's in love with an unavailable older man and is saddled with
                staggering college debt. She has a crazy mother and doesn't know who her father is. A chance encounter leads
                her to an internship in South America with the world-famous Sunlight Project, which uses the internet to
                expose government and corporate fraud and malfeasance. TSP is the brainchild of Andreas Wolf, a charismatic
                genius who grew up privileged but disaffected in the German Democratic Republic. Forced to run TSP in Bolivia
                because of the hostility of European nations whose misdeeds he has exposed, Andreas is drawn to Pip for reasons
                she doesn't understand. Like numerous women before her, she becomes obsessed with Andreas, and they have
                an intense, unsettling relationship. Eventually, he finds her work at an online magazine in Denver with Tom
                Aberant, who, with his life partner, Leila Helou, uses old-fashioned reporting to achieve some of the same
                results that TSP seems to pull out of thin air.</p>
            <p> That's the top story. What lies underneath is a wild tale of hidden identities, secret wealth, neurotic fidelity,
                sociopathy and murder. The truth of Pip's parentage lies at the center of this maelstrom, but before it is
                resolved Franzen takes us from the rain-drenched forests of northern California, to paranoid East Berlin
                before the fall of the Wall, to the paradisiacal mountain valleys of Bolivia, exposing us to the vagaries
                of radical politics, the problematic seductions of the internet, and the no-holds-barred war between the
                sexes.
            </p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>"Oh pussycat, I'm so glad to hear your voice," the girl's mother said on the telephone. "My body is betraying
                me again. Sometimes I think my life is nothing but one long process of bodily betrayal."</p>
