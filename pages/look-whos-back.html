            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Berlin, Summer 2011. Adolf Hitler wakes up on a patch of open ground, alive and well. Things have changed – no
                Eva Braun, no Nazi party, no war. Hitler barely recognises his beloved Fatherland, filled with immigrants
                and run by a woman.</p>
            <p>People certainly recognise him, albeit as a flawless impersonator who refuses to break character. The unthinkable,
                the inevitable happens, and the ranting Hitler goes viral, becomes a YouTube star, gets his own T.V. show,
                and people begin to listen. But the Führer has another programme with even greater ambition – to set the
                country he finds a shambles back to rights.</p>
            <p><i>Look Who’s Back</i> stunned and then thrilled 1.5 million German readers with its fearless approach to the
                most taboo of subjects. Naive yet insightful, repellent yet strangely sympathetic, the revived Hitler unquestionably
                has a spring in his step.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>It was probably the German people, the Volk, which surprised me most of all. I really did everything humanly
                possible to destroy the foundations for a future existence on this soil, this soil which the enemy had desecrated.
                Bridges, power stations, roads, railways - I gave instructions for every last one to be obliterated. I have
                since checked when this order was issued - it was in March - and I believe I had made myself perfectly clear.
                All supply facilities were to be razed, waterworks, telephone systems, resources, factories, workshops, farms,
                all material assets - everything, and by that I did mean absolutely everything! These matters must be approached
                with care and precision; a directive such as this can leave no room for doubt. For all we know of the ordinary
                soldier at the front who, contained within his own particular sector, understandably lacks an overview of
                the general situation, knowledge of the strategic, tactical necessities. The soldier who comes and says,
                "Do I really have to set light to this ... this ... [let's say] kiosk, too? Can't we let it fall into enemy
                lands? Is it really so bad if the kiosk falls into enemy hands?" Bad? Of course it's bad! The enemy reads
                newspapers too, doesn't he? He will use the kiosk to conduct business, he will turn the kiosk against us,
                everything he finds will be turned against us! Every material asset - let me underline this once more - every
                single material asset mustg be destroyed. Not just houses, but doors too. And door handles. Then the screws,
                and not only the long ones. The screws must be unscrewed and then ruthlessly bent out of shape. The doors
                must be ground into sawdust. And then burned to cinders. Else the enemy will show no mercy; he will walk
                in and out of these doors as it pleases him. But present him with a broken door handle, bent screws and a
                heap of ashes - well, Mr Churchill, be my guest! At all events these requirements are the brutal consequence
                of war - of this I have always been aware - and thus the instructions I gave could not have been worded differently,
                even though the background to my directive was different.</p>
