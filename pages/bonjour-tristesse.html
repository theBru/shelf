            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p><i>Bonjour Tristesse</i> tells the story of Cécile, who leads a carefree life with her widowed father and his
                young mistress until, one hot summer on the Riviera, he decides to remarry - with devastating consequences.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>This strange new feeling of mine, obsessing me by its sweet languor, is such that I am reluctant to dignify it
                with the fine, solemn name of 'sadness'. It is a feeling so self-indulgent and complete in itself that I
                am almost ashamed of it, whereas I had always looked upon sadness as being a worthy emotion. Before, I did
                not know what sadness was, though I knew wat it was to be languorous, to have regrets and, more rarely, to
                feel remorse. Today it is as if I am enfolded in some silken thing, soft and enervating that sets me apart
                from others.</p>
