            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Los Angeles PI Philip Marlowe is working for the Sternwood family. Old man Sternwood, crippled and wheelchair-bound,
                is being given the squeeze by a blackmailer and he wants Marlowe to make the problem go away. But with Sternwood's
                two wild, devil-may-care daughters prowling LA's seedy backstreets, Marlowe's got his work cut out - and
                that's before he stumbles over the first corpse.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>It was about eleven o'clock in the morning, mid October, with the Sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain
                in the clearness of the foothills. I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display
                handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and
                sober, and I didn't care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be. I
                was calling on four million dollars.</p>
