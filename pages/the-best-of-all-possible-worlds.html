            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>A proud and reserved alien society finds its homeland destroyed in an unprovoked act of aggression, and the survivors
                have no choice but to reach out to the indigenous humanoids of their adopted world, to whom they are distantly
                related. They wish to preserve their cherished way of life but come to discover that in order to preserve
                their culture, they may have to change it forever.</p>
            <p>Now a man and a woman from these two clashing societies must work together to save this vanishing race—and end
                up uncovering ancient mysteries with far-reaching ramifications. As their mission hangs in the balance, this
                unlikely team—one cool and cerebral, the other fiery and impulsive—just may find in each other their own
                destinies . . . and a force that transcends all.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>He always set aside twelve days of his annual retreat to finish up reports and studies, and that left twelve
                more for everything else. In earlier times, he had foolishly tried retreats within comm-reach of his workplace,
                and that was not at all helpful. There would always be some crisis, something for which his help would be
                required. As his salary and sense increased, he took his retreats further and further away, until at last
                he found himself going off-planet to distant temples where the rule of silence and solitude could not be
                broken by convenient technologies.</p>
