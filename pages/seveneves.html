            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>What would happen if the world were ending?
            </p>
            <p>A catastrophic event renders the earth a ticking time bomb. In a feverish race against the inevitable, nations
                around the globe band together to devise an ambitious plan to ensure the survival of humanity far beyond
                our atmosphere, in outer space.</p>
            <p>But the complexities and unpredictability of human nature coupled with unforeseen challenges and dangers threaten
                the intrepid pioneers, until only a handful of survivors remain . . .</p>
            <p>Five thousand years later, their progeny—seven distinct races now three billion strong—embark on yet another
                audacious journey into the unknown . . . to an alien world utterly transformed by cataclysm and time: Earth.</p>
            <h3>Openning</h3>
            <p>The Moon blew up without warning and for no apparent reason. It was waxing, only one day short of full. The time
                was 05:03:12 UTC. Later it would be designated A+0.0.0, or simply Zero.</p>
