            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Weary of her storybook, one "without pictures or conversations," the young and imaginative Alice follows a hasty hare underground--to come face-to-face with some of the strangest adventures and most fantastic characters in all of literature.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
