            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>What would happen if the world were ending?
            </p>
            <p>"You've long set your heart against it, Axl, I know. But it's time now to think on it anew. There's a journey
                we must go on, and no more delay..."</p>
            <p><i>The Buried Giant</i> begins as a couple set off across a troubled land of mist and rain in the hope of finding
                a son they have not seen in years.</p>
            <p>Sometimes savage, often intensely moving, Kazuo Ishiguro's first novel in nearly a decade is about lost memories,
                love, revenge, and war.</p>
            <h3>Openning</h3>
            <p>You would have searched a long time for the sort of winding lane or tranquil meadow for which England later became
                celbrated. There were instead miles of desolate, uncultivated land; here and there rough-hewn paths over
                craggy hills or bleak moorland. Most of the roads left by the Romans would by then have become broken or
                overgrown, often fading into wilderness. Icy fogs hung over rivers and marshes, serving all too well the
                ogres that were then still native to this land. The people who lived nearby - one wonders what desolation
                led them to settle in such gloomy spots - might well have feared these creatures, whose panting breaths could
                be heard long before their deformed figures emerged from the mist. But such monsters were not cause for astonishment.
                People then would have regarded them as everyday hazards, and in those days there was so much else to worry
                about. How to get food out of the hard ground; how not to run out of firewood; how to stop the sickness that
                could kill a dozen pigs in a single day and produce green rashes on the cheeks of children.</p>
