            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>1945, Lake Como. Mussolini and his mistress are captured and shot by local partisans. The precise circumstances
                of Il Duce's death remain shrouded in confusion and controversy.</p>
            <p>1992, Milan. Colonna takes a job at a fledgling newspaper financed by a powerful media magnate. There he learns
                the paranoid theories of Braggadocio, who is convinced that Mussolini's corpse was a body-double and part
                of a wider fascist plot.</p>
            <p>Colonna is sceptical. But when a body is found, stabbed to death in a back alley, and the paper is shut down,
                even he is jolted out of his complacency.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>No water in the tap this morning.</p>
