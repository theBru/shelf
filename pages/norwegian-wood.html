            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>When he hears her favourite Beatles song, Toru Watanabe recalls his first love Naoko, the girlfriend of his best friend Kizuki. Immediately he is transported back almost twenty years to his student days in Tokyo, adrift in a world of uneasy friendships, casual sex, passion, loss and desire - to a time when an impetuous young woman called Midori marches into his life and he has to choose between the future and the past.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>I was 37 then, strapped in my seat as the huge 747 plunged through dense cloud on approach to Hamburg airport. Cold November rains drenched the earth, lending everything the gloomy air of a Flemish landscape: the ground crew in waterproofs, a flag atop a squat airpot building, a BMW billboard. So - Germany again.</p>
