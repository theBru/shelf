            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Philosophy begins with questions about the nature of reality and how we should live. These were the concerns
                of Socrates, who spent his days in the ancient Athenian marketplace asking awkward questions, disconcerting
                the people he met by showing them how little they genuinely understood. This engaging book introduces the
                great thinkers in Western philosophy and explores their most compelling ideas about the world and how best
                to live in it.
            </p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>About 2,400 years ago in Athens a man was put to death for asking too many questions. There were philosophers
                before him, but it was with Socrates that the subject really took off. If philosophy has a patron saint,
                it is Socrates.</p>
