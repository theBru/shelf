            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>In a work of profound and lasting importance, Albert Hourani tells the definitive history of thr Arab peoples
                from the seventh century, when the new religion of Islam began to spread from the Arabian Peninsula westwards,
                to the present day.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>In the year 1382 an Arab Muslim scholar who served the ruler of Tunis asked his permission to make the pilgrimage
                to Mecca, and having received it took ship for Alexandria in Egypt. In his fiftieth year he was leaving,
                as it turned out for ever, the countries of the Maghrib in which he and his ancestors had played an important
                and varied part.</p>
