            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Set in Earth's future, the novel presents an imperiled mankind after two conflicts with the "buggers", an insectoid alien species. In preparation for an anticipated third invasion, children, including the novel's protagonist, Ender Wiggin, are trained from a very young age through increasingly difficult games including some in zero gravity, where Ender's tactical genius is revealed.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>"I've watched through his eyes, I've listened through his ears, and I tell you he's the one. Or at least as close as we're going to get."</p>
