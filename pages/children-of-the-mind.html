            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>The planet Lusitania is home to three sentient species: the Pequeninos; a large colony of humans; and the Hive Queen, brought there by Ender. But once again the human race has grown fearful; the Starways Congress has gathered a fleet to destroy Lusitania.</p>
            <p>Jane, the evolved computer intelliegence, can save the three sentient races of Lusitania. She has learned how to move ships outside the universe, and then instantly back to a different world, abolishing the light-speed limit. But It takes all the processing power available to her, and the Starways Congress is shutting down the Net, world by world.</p>
            <p>Soon Jane will not be able to move the ships. Enderâ€™s children must save her if they are to save themselves.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>Si Wang-mu stepped forward. The young man named Peter took her hand and led her into the starship. The door closed behind them.</p>
