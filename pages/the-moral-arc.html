            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>From Galileo and Newton to Thomas Hobbes and Martin Luther King, Jr., thinkers throughout history have consciously
                employed scientific techniques to better understand the non-physical world. The Age of Reason and the Enlightenment
                led theorists to apply scientific reasoning to the non-scientific disciplines of politics, economics, and
                moral philosophy. Instead of relying on the woodcuts of dissected bodies in old medical texts, physicians
                opened bodies themselves to see what was there; instead of divining truth through the authority of an ancient
                holy book or philosophical treatise, people began to explore the book of nature for themselves through travel
                and exploration; instead of the supernatural belief in the divine right of kings, people employed a natural
                belief in the right of democracy.</p>
            <p>In this provocative and compelling book, Shermer will explain how abstract reasoning, rationality, empiricism,
                skepticism—scientific ways of thinking—have profoundly changed the way we perceive morality and, indeed,
                move us ever closer to a more just world.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>About eight thousand people gather at Brown Chapel and begin to march from the town of Selma to the city of Montgomery,
                Alabama. The demonstrators are predominantly African American and they're marching on the capitol for one
                reason: Justice. They want simply to be given the right to vote. But they're not alone in their struggle.
                Demonstrators of "every race, religion and class" representing almost every state, have come to march with
                their black brothers and sisters. And at the front of the march is the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
                Nobel Prize winner, preacher, and civil rights activist, leading the march like Moses leading his people
                out of Egypt.</p>
