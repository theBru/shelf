            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>The Stone of Tear, fortress of legend, as been taken and Callandor, the Sword That Is Not a Sword, is held. But for Rand al'Thor, the shepherd who has become the Dragon Reborn, it is only the beginning.</p>
            <p>As his friends and enemies alike plot and mobilize, the Lord Dragon studies the texts of the prophecies and struggles to control the Power that is his. But all know that it must be war - war against the Forsaken and all who oppose the Dragon Reborn. And the prison that holds the Dark One is slowly but inexorably, losing its power. In the final battle, Rand al'Thor knows who he must face...</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, and Age long past, a wind rose on the great plain called the Caralain Grass. The wind was not the begnning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.</p>
