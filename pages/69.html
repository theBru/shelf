            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>It's summer of 1969, and Kensuke Yazaki is seventeen and interested in evrything: the Rolling Stones, Rimbaud, the Velvet Underground, French New Wave, Jimi Hendrix, political protest and Janis Joplin, all of which is happening in a long way away. But Kensuke and his friends are going to bring 1969 to their provincial Japanese city, start a dissident movement, barricade their school, make a film, stage a festival. Not for the sake of art or politics, for a much better reason, for the only real reason. To impress girls.</p>
            <p>Murakami's uncharacteristically sweet, semi-autobiographical account of an exciting time to be an exciting age, <i>69</i> is funny and affectionate, brimful of passion, and as irrepressible as the brilliant brazen smartass Kensuke himself.</p>
