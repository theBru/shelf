            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>A fascinating illustrated tour of fabled places in literature and folklore that have awed, tourbled, and eluded
                us through the ages.</p>
            <p>From the epic poets of antiquity to contemporary writers of science fiction, from the authors of the Holy Scriptures
                to modern raconteurs of fairy tales, writers and storytellers through the ages have invented imaginary and
                mythical lands, projecting onto them all of our human dreams, ideals, and fears.</p>
            <p>In the tradition of his acclaimed <i>History of Beauty</i>, <i>On Ugliness</i>, and <i>The Infinity of Lists</i>,
                renowned writer and cultural critic Umberto Eco leads us on a beautifully illustrated journey through these
                lands of myth and invention, showing us their inhabitants, the passions that rule them, their heroes and
                antangonists, and, above all, the importance they hold for us. He explores this human urge to create such
                places, the utopias and dystopias where our imagination can confront things that are too incredible or challenging
                for our limited real world.</p>
            <p>Illuminated with more than 300 coloured images, <i>The Book of Legendary Lands</i> is both erudite and thoroughly
                enjoyable, bringing together disparate elements of our shared literary legacy in a way only Umberto Eco can.
                Homer's poems and other ancient and medieval texts are presented side by side with <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>                and <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>; Tolkien shares space with Marco Polo's <i>Books of the Marvel's of the World</i>;
                films complement poems, and comics inform novels. Together these stories have influenced the sensibilities
                and worldview of all of us.</p>
