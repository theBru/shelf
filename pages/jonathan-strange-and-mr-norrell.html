            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>In the midst of the Napoleonic Wars in 1806, most people believe magic to have long since disappeared from England ? until the reclusive Mr. Norrell reveals his powers and becomes an overnight celebrity. Another practicing magician then emerges: the young and daring Jonathan Strange. He becomes Norrell?s pupil, and the two join forces in the war against France. But Strange is increasingly drawn to the wild, most perilous forms of magic, and he soon risks sacrificing not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything else he holds dear.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>Some years ago there was in the city of York a society of magicians. They met upon the third Wednesday of every month read each other long, dull papers upon the history of English magic.</p>
