            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Today's web technologies are evolving at near-light speed, bringing the promise of a seamless Internet ever closer to reality. When users can browse the Web on a three-inch phone screen as easily as on a fifty-inch HDTV, what's a developer to do?</p>
            <p>Peter Gasston's <i>The Modern Web</i> will guide you through the latest and most important tools of device-agnostic web development, including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. His plain-English explanations and practical examples emphasize the techniques, principles, and practices that you'll need to easily transcend individual browser quirks and stay relevant as these technologies are updated.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>We are in a time of unprecedented innovation on the Web. Not too long ago, one company, Microsoft, dominated the web landscape: in 2003, Internet Explorer was used some 95 percent of computers worldwide. This domination brought the advantage of a stable market for developers, but there was also a serious drawback: Microsoft chose to end nonessential work in IE, and innovation on the Web stagnated - a consequence of a lack of competition and a closed environment.</p>
