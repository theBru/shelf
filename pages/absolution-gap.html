            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Mankind has endured centuries of horrific plague and a particularly brutal interstellar war ... but there is
                still no time for peace and quiet.</p>
            <p>Stirred from aeons of sleep, the Inhibitors - ancient alien killing machines - have begun the process of riding
                the galaxy of its latest emergent intelligence: mankind. As a ragtag bag of refugees fleeing the first wave
                of the cull head towards an apparently insignificant moon light-years away, they discover an avenging angel,
                a girl born in ice. She has the power to lead mankind to safety, and the ability to draw down their darkest
                enemy.
            </p>
            <p>And on a planet where vast travelling cathedrals crawl towards the treacherous fissure known as Absolution Gap,
                an unsettling truth becomes apparent: to beat one enemy, it may be necessary to forge an alliance with something
                much, much worse ...</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>She stands alone at the jetty's end, watching the sky. In the moonlight, the planked boarding of the jetty is
                a shimmering silver-blue ribbon reaching back to shore. The sea is ink-black, lapping calmly against the
                jetty's supports. Across the bay, out towards the western horizon, there are patches of luminosity: smudges
                of twinkling pastel-green, as if a fleet of galleons has gone down with all lights ablaze.</p>
