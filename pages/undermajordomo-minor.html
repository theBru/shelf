            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Lucien (Lucy) Minor is the resident odd duck in the bucolic hamlet of Bury. Friendless and loveless, young and
                aimless, he is a compulsive liar and a melancholy weakling. When Lucy accepts employment assisting the majordomo
                of the remote, forbidding castle of the Baron Von Aux he meets thieves, madmen, aristocrats, and a puppy.
                He also meets Klara, a delicate beauty who is, unfortunately, already involved with an exceptionally handsome
                partisan soldier. Thus begins a tale of polite theft, bitter heartbreak, domestic mystery and cold-blooded
                murder in which every aspect of human behaviour is laid bare for our hero to observe. Lucy must stay safe,
                and protect his puppy, because someone or something is roaming the corridors of the castle late at night.</p>
            <p><i>Undermajordomo Minor</i> is a triumphant ink-black comedy of manners by the Man Booker shortlisted author
                of <i>The Sisters Brothers</i>. It is an adventure story, and a mystery, and a searing portrayal of rural
                Alpine bad behaviour with a brandy tart, but above all it is a love story. And Lucy must be careful, for
                love is a violent thing.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>Lucien Minor's mother had not wept, had not come close to weeping at their parting. All that day he;d felt a
                catch in his throat and his every movement was achieved in chary degrees, as though swift activity would
                cause a breach of emotion. They had eaten breakfast and lunch together but neither had spoken a word, and
                now it was time for him to go but he couldn't step away from his bed, upon which he lay fully dressed, in
                coat and boots, sheepsin cap pulled low, to his brow. Lucy was seventeen years old, and this had been his
                room since birth; all that he could see and put his hand to was permeated with the bewildering memories of
                childhood. When he heard his mother positing unknowable questions to herself from the scullery downstairs
                he was nearly overcome with sorrow. A valise stood alertly on the floor beside him.</p>
