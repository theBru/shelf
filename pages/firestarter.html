            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>First, a man and a woman are subjects of a top-secret government experiment designed to produce extraordinary psychic powers.</p>
            <p>Then, they are married and have a child. A daughter.</p>
            <p>Early on the daughter shows signs of a wild and horrifying force growing within her. Desperately, her parents try to train her to keep that force in check, to "act normal."</p>
            <p>Now the government wants its brainchild back - for its own insane ends.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>"Daddy, I'm tired," the little girl in red pants and the green blouse said fretfully. "Can't we stop?"</p>
