            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>The capital of Arelon, the home to people transformed into magic-using demigods by the Shaod.</p>
            <p>But then the magic failed, Elantris started to rot, and its inhabitants turned into powerless wrecks.</p>
            <p>And in the new capital, Kae, close enough to Elantris for everyone to be reminded of what they have lost, a princess arrives. Sarene is to be married to unite Teod and Arelon against the religious imperialists of Fjordell. But she is told
                that Raoden, her husband to be, is dead.</p>
            <p>Determined to carry on the fight for Teod and Arelon's freedom, Sarene clashes with the high priest Hrathen. If Hrathen can persuade the populace to convert, Fjordell will reign supreme.</p>
            <p>But there are secrets in Elantris, the dead and the ruined may yet have a role to play in this new world. Magic lives.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>Elantris was beautiful once. It was called the city of the gods: a place of power, radiance, and magic. Visitors say that the very stones glowed with an inner light, and that the city contained wondrous arcane marvels. At night, Elantris shone
                like a silvery fire, visible even from a great distance.</p>
