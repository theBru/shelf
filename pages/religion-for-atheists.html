            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>"What if religions are neither all true nor all nonsense?". Alain de Botton's bold and provocative book argues that we can benefit from the wisdom and power of religion - without having to believe in any of it.</p>
            <p>He suggests that rather than mocking religion, agnostics and atheists should instead steal from it - because the world's religions are packed with good ideas on how we might live and arrange our societies. De Botton looks to religion for insights into how to build a sense of community, make relationships last, overcome feelings of envy and inadequacy, inspire travel, get more out of art, and reconnect with the natural world. For too long non-believers have faced a stark choice between swallowing lots of peculiar doctrines or doing away with a range of consoling and beautiful rituals and ideas. <i>Religion for Atheists</i> offers a far more interesting and truly helpful alternative.</p>
            

            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>The most boring and unproductive question one can ask of any religion is whether or not it is true - in terms of being handed down from heaven to the sound of trumpets and supernaturally governed by prophets and celestial beings.</p>
