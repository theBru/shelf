            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Rarely does adolescent love reach its full potential, but what happens when two young lovers reunite after eleven years? Time has transformed Pilar into a strong and independent woman, while her devoted childhood friend has grown into a handsome and charismatic spiritual leader. She has learned well how to bury her feelings... and he has turned to religion as a refuge from his raging inner conflicts.</p>
            <p>Now they are together once again, embarking on a journey fraught with difficulties, as long-buried demons of blame and resentment resurface after more than a decade. But in a small village in the French Pyrenees, by the waters of the River Piedra, a most special relationship will be reexamined in the dazzling light of some of lifeâ€™s biggest questions.</p>   
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>The place where the conference was held was more formal than I had imagined it, and there were more people there than I had expected. How had all this come about?</p>
