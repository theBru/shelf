            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Esther Greenwood is brilliant, beautiful, enormously talented, and successful, but slowly going underâ€”maybe for the last time.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York. I'm stupid about executions. The idea of being electrocuted makes me sick, and that's all there was to read about in the papers -- goggle-eyed headlines staring up at me on every street corner and at the fusty, peanut-smelling mouth of every subway. It had nothing to do with me, but I couldn't help wondering what it would be like, being burned alive all along your nerves.</p>
