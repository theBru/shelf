            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Six years ago, the Assassin in White, a hireling of the inscrutable Parshendi, assassinated the Alethi king on
                the very night a treaty between men and Parshendi was being celebrated. So began the Vengeance Pact among
                the highprinces of Alethkar and the War of Reckoning against the Parshendi.
            </p>
            <p>Now the Assassin is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to
                thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered
                the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin's
                master has much deeper motives.</p>
            <p>Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command
                of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status "darkeyes." Now he must protect the king
                and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while
                secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.</p>
            <p>Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge,
                she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending
                Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving
                there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by
                years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to
                risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences
                for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>Jasnah Kholin pretended to enjoy the party, giving no indication that she intended to have one of the guests
                killed.</p>
