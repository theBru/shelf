            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>For nearly six years, in Room 217 of the Lakes Region Traumatic Brain Injury Clinic, Brady Hartsfield has been
                in a persistent vegetative state. A complete recovery seems unlikely for the insane perpatrator of the "Mercedes
                Massacre", in which eight people were killed and many more maimed for life. But behind the vacant stare,
                Brady is very much awake and aware, having been pumped full of experimental drugs ... scheming, biding his
                time as he trains himself to take full advantage of the deadly new powers that allow him to wreak unimaginable
                havoc without ever leaving his hospital room. Brady Hartsfield is about to embark on a new reign of terror
                against thousands of innocents, hell-bent on taking revenge against anyone who crossed his path - with retired
                detective Bill Hodges at the very top of that long list ...</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>It's always darkest before the dawn.</p>
