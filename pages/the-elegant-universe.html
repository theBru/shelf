            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Brian Greene, one of the world's leading string theorists, peels away layers of mystery to reveal a universe that consists of eleven dimensions, where the fabric of space tears and repairs itself, and all matter—from the smallest quarks to the most gargantuan supernovas—is generated by the vibrations of microscopically tiny loops of energy.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>Calling it a cover-up would be too dramatic. But for more than half a century--even in the midst of some of the greatest scientific achievements in history---physicists have been quietly aware of a dark cloud looming on a distant horizon. The problem is this: There are two foundational pillars upon which modern physics rests. One is Albert Einstein's general relativity, which provides a theoretical framework for understanding the universe on the largest of scales: stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and beyond to the immense expanse of the universe itself. The other is quntum mechanics, which priovides a theoretical framework for understanding the universe on the smallest of scales: molecules, atoms, and all the way down to subatomic particles like electrons and quarks. Through years of research, physicists have experimentally confirmed to almost unimaginable accuracy virtually all predictions made by each of these theories. But these same theoretical tools inexorably lead to another disturbing conclusion: As they are currently formulates, general relativity and quantum mechanics cannot both be right. The two theories underlying the tremendous progress of physics during the last hundred years--progress that has explained the expansion of the heavens and the fundamental structure of matter--are mutually incompatible.</p>
