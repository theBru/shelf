            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Sagan's second novel tells the story of Dominique, a bored twenty year old law student at the Sorbonne in mid-1950's Paris, who embarks on a love affair with a middle-aged man.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>We had been spending the afternoon in a cfe on Rue Sains-Jacques, an afternoon in springtime like any other. I was quietly rather bored: I was moving back and forth between the jukebox and the window while Bertrand discussed Spire's lecture. I remember that, at one moment, leaning against the jukebox, I had watched the record rise slowly and then place itself at an angle against the needle, almost tenderly, as it it were a cheek. And I don't know why but I was suffused with a fierce sense of happiness and with the overwhelming, almost palpable intuition that I was going to die one day and that there would no longer be this hand of mine on the chrome ledge, nor sun in my eyes.</p>
