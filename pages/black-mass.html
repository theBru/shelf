            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Our conventional view of history and human progress is wrong. It is founded on pernicious myth of an achievable
                utopia that in the last century alone caused the murder of tens of millions. In <i>Black Mass</i> John Gray
                tears down the religious, political and secular beliefs that we insist are fundamental to the human project
                and shows us how a misplaced faith in our ability to improve the world has actually made it far worse.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>Modern politics is a chapter in the history of religion. The greatest of the revolutionary upheavals that have
                shaped so much of the history of the past two centuries were episodes in the history of faith - moments in
                the long dissolution of Christianity and the rise of modern political religion. The world in which we find
                ourselves at the start of the new millenium is littered with the debris of utopian projects, which though
                they were framed in secular terms that denied the truth of religion were in fact vehicles for religious myths.</p>
