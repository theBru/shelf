<h2>Hello world</h2>
<p>My name is Gurur and this is my little site about books. There is an entry for every book I've read, with some blurb about
    the things I found out about it on the interwebz. This will be a an ongoing WIP, since I've never really fully committed
    to taking a note of the books I've read (occasional bursts of GoodReads entries aside).</p>
<p>Tl;dr - this site will probably never be completed.</p>
<p>On the side panel to the right of this text you will see an alphabetical ordering of books. Should you want to browse by
    authors, you can toggle this in the navigation bar.</p>
<p>For those interested, this is a CMS-free site that uses jQuery. No db, so it's all manual. Why? No reason other than I didn't
    want to learn another static site generator and trawl through its documentation to do the simplest of things.</p>
<p>Anyway, enjoy browsing.</p>
