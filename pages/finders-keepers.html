            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>"Wake up, genius". So announces deranged fan Morris Bellamy to iconic author John Rothstein, who once created
                the famous character Jimmy Gold and hasn't released anything since. Morris is livid, not just because his
                favourite writer has stopped publishing, but because Jimmy Gold ended up as a sellout. Morris kills his idol
                and empties his safe of cash, but the real haul is a collection of notebooks containing John Rothstein's
                unpublished work ... including at least one more Jimmy Gold novel. Morris hides everything away before being
                locked up for another horrific crime. But upon Morris's release thirty-five years later, he's about to discover
                that teenager Pete Saubers has already found the stolen treasure - and no one but former police detective
                Bill Hodges, along with his trusted associates Holly Gibney and Jerome Robinson, stands in the way of his
                vengeance...
