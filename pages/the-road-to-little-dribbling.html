            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>In 1995 Bill Bryson got into his car and took a weeks-long farewell motoring trip about England before moving
                his family back to the United States. The book about that trip, <i>Notes from a Small Island</i>, is uproarious
                and endlessly endearing, one of the most acute and affectionate portrayals of England in all its glorious
                eccentricity ever written. Two decades later, he set out again to rediscover that country, and the result
                is <i>The Road to Little Dribbling</i>. Nothing is funnier than Bill Bryson on the roadâ€”prepare for the total
                joy and multiple episodes of unseemly laughter.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>One of the things that happens when you get older is that you discover lotas of new ways to hurt yourself. Recently,
                in France, I was hit square on the head by an automatic parking barrier, something I don't think I could
                have managed in my younger, more alert years.</p>
