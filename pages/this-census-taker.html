            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>In a remote house on a hilltop, a lonely boy witnesses a traumatic event. He tries - and fails - to flee. Left
                alone with his increasingly deranged parent, he dreams of safety, of joining the other children in the town
                below, of escape.</p>
            <p>When at last a stranger knocks at his door, the boy senses that his days of isolation might be over. But by what
                authority does this man keep the meticulous records he carries? What is the purpose behind his questions?
                Is he a friend? Enemy? Or something else altogether?</p>
