            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>The civilization most northern outpost, a lonely metro station, attacked by mysterious creatures that somehow
                have awoken in the recent war. The world lies in ruins, the surface is contaminated, and a prey to the sun's
                deadly rays. One last human remnant have sought protection in the Metro, the world's largest nuclear bomb
                secure bunker, where stations have been transformed into small city states with their own ideologies and
                governments.
            </p>
            <p>Everywhere there is a constant struggle for living space, water filters, electric heaters and fungal cultures,
                all while darkness and terror reigns in the tunnels.</p>
            <p>A young man is forced out on a dangerous journey through the subterranean maze of tunnels, shafts and sidings,
                where nobody knows what to expect around the next corner.</p>
