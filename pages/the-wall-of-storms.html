            <h3>Back cover</h3>
            <p>Dara is united under the Empror Ragin, once known as Kuni Garu, the bandit king. There has been peace for six years, but the Dandelion Throne rests on bloody foundations - Kuni's betrayal of his friend, Mata Zyndu, the Hegemon. The Hegemon's rule was brutal and unbending - but he died well, creating a legend that haunts the new emperor, no matter what good he strives to do.</p>
            <p>Where war once forged unbreakable bonds between Kuni's inner circle, peace now gnaws at their loyalties. Where ancient wisdoms once held sway, a brilliant scholar promises a philosophical revolution. And from the far north, over the horizon, comes a terrible new threat ...</p>
            <p>The scent of blood is in the water.</p>
            <h3>Opening</h3>
            <p>The sky was overcast, and the cold wind whipped a few scattered snowflakes through the air. Carriages and pedestrians in thick coats and fur-lines hates hurried through the wide avenues of Pan, the Harmonious City; seeking the warmth of home.</p>
